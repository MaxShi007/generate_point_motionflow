## Generate Point Motion Flow

> Some scripts developed by Jiadai Sun.

Due to the slightly long time, this code was developed around July to August 2021.

The implementation of some code may not be so satisfactory, there are some hard code and redundant code comments.

If necessary for subsequent development, you can further clean the code.

### Usage
```bash
python process_point_motionflow.py
```
